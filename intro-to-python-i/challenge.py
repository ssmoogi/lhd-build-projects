Let's tie all of our skills together!

I want to see 10 lists of random numbers. 
The first list will have 0 items, the second will have 1 item, the third will have 2 items, etc.

Each list item will be a random Integer between 0 and 100. 

If we print all of the lists, it should look something like this:

[]
[65]
[57, 71]
[51, 30, 84]
[39, 10, 38, 73]
[33, 25, 48, 10, 73]
[15, 13, 20, 72, 76, 6]
[73, 75, 85, 83, 66, 98, 32]
[64, 8, 79, 13, 14, 26, 46, 56]
[48, 59, 19, 90, 25, 56, 78, 84, 62]


Hints:

> We'll need to write a function that generates a list of random numbers. 
  The function needs to know how many items will be in the list (a parameter!)
  
  It could look something like this:
  
  def generate_random_list(length_of_list):
    # create a random list of items and return it
  
> We'll need to loop a piece of code 10 times - inside this loop, we'll need to call 
  our generate_random_list() function.
