Intro to Python Skills for AI, Part I 
=================

Welcome to the workshop!

This is where we are going to write and run our code. 

Click `Tools` (at the bottom of this page) -> `Logs` -> Console` to run your Python scripts. 

Python scripts have the file extension `.py`.

To run a Python script, type `python variables.py` (or any other file name) and hit enter. You will see the output of the script in the Console window.
